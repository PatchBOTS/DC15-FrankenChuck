# DC-15 FRANKENCHUCK


## Overview
This repository is for the files needed to modify a WoodChuck DC-15 blaster rifle as seen in the video above

## 3D Files
The 3D files are free for download. I'm happy to distribute these files for free but they are not gauranteed to work.  I very big on the "print quick and dirty and fix later" philosophy, so there may be some physcial editing to the parts needed which I did not document.
